battery not removable yet there's also very clearly written pull up from the side with that many mixed messages this battery we can very well in politics it is removable though which also correlates nicely with politics at the local messaging early often about what happens when they put their tiny tool in the wrong hole for the sim card ejections one posted put both hold really close together the microphone in the sim card tray but even if the sim tool does go all the way back into the microphone hole nothing bad happens I'll show you in a second down here at the bottom we have little circuit board alone took issue with the wire cables and the reason cable and remove the 2 screws holding down the charging port even though this phone has an ingress protection rating there is still white water damage indicators all inside the phone no phone is waterproof removing the board we can see that the water resistant mesh over the microphone hole is still on punctured since it's off to the side of the shaft along with the microphone itself most phones are built this way so don't stress too much if you ever get the whole wrong this little board just includes the dual sim card reader the charging port board can peel up and out of the phone next
